## ABOUT

I got this idea from scrolling through TikTok and watching some tarot readings for the collective. After a while, I began to develop an interest in knowing the meaning of each card and how it can help guide those called to delivering readings. Tarot helps bridge us with Universe/Spirit/angels/Higher self. 

Tarot **is** a bridge. Bridging, linking us all(ourself, Universe, reader) to connect.

An **_energy connection._**
